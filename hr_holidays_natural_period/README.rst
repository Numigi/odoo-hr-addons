THe module allows you to define natural day option in request unit on holidays type.

For using natural period on leaves:

   to the form view for selecting start and end dates.

#. If no leave type is yet specified, then default configuration is to exclude
   public holidays.

#. I see that the number of days will be computed without employee calendar used.
